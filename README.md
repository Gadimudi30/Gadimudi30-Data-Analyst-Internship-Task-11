# Task 11 – A/B Testing (Hypothesis Testing)

In this task, I performed A/B testing on an e-commerce dataset to compare conversion rates between Email users (Test group) and other users (Control group).

# Steps performed:
- Loaded dataset using pandas
- Created control and test groups
- Calculated conversion rates
- Applied t-test using scipy
- Calculated p-value and confidence interval
- Visualized results
- Made business recommendation

# Result:
The p-value was greater than 0.05, so there is no statistically significant difference between the groups.

# Conclusion:
Current strategy should be continued.

# Tools used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Google Colab
